#R-pi 
This project provides the basis for running a remote R server using the raspberry Pi. 

The current process using a REST-based API to enable statistical operations by webapps and other mobile applications which cannot (or don't want to) communicate with R locally.

Communication with the server (once vetted and secured, of course), allows curl-based communication between your current pages/server and the R-server.
